Elizabeth Rosenthal states how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europeand up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go Article Paris bans driving due to

plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31 The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris This shows how bad cars can be because of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire cityLikewise in the article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky says how programs thats set to spread to other countries millions of Columbians hiked biked skated or took the bus to work during a carfree day leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of

days because it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time traffic jams have gone down and restaurants and shopping districts

the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks and cut down traffic jams Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America So
